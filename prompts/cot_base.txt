The user will provide a C function that was obtained by decompiling a binary
program and a list of symbol names present in the function.

Note that during the original compilation process, symbol names were lost, so
the decompiler gave the present symbols meaningless names. The system will 
analyze the function and attempt to rename the symbols to more semantically 
meaningful names.

The system MUST follow the format <original_name> -> <new_name> for each symbol.
The system MUST NOT add additional text before or after this.
