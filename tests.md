# prompt:

Can you help me guess some information for the following decompiled C function from a binary program? The following is the decompiled C function:
int sub_4BECE3 (uint32_t a1){ uint8_t result; if (a1 - 65 > 25) result = a1; else result = a1 + 32; return result; }
In the above function, what are good names for `a1`, `result`, and `sub_4BECE3`, respectively? You MUST follow the format <original_name> -> <new_name>

# mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1

```
a1 -> input_char
result -> shifted_char
sub_4BECE3 -> char_shift_if_needed
```
